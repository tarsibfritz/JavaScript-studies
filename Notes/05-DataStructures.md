## What is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** is a way of organizing, managing, and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures allow us to handle data logically and help define relationships between different pieces of data.

In JavaScript, data structures fall into different categories, mainly **indexed collections**, **keyed collections**, and **structured data**. Let's go over each.

### Types of Data Structures in JavaScript

1. **Indexed Collections**
    
    Indexed collections allow us to store data in an ordered fashion and access it by an index.
    
    - **Arrays**
        - An **array** is an ordered collection of elements that can store values of any type.
        - Elements are accessed using zero-based indexing (the first element is at index `0`).
        - Arrays are flexible, and methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, and `.unshift()` allow us to add or remove elements easily.
        - **When to Use**: Use arrays when you need an ordered list of items or plan to access items by index. Good for lists that may include duplicates and when you need array-specific methods.
        
        **Example:**
        
        ```jsx
        let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
        
        console.log(fruits[1]); // "banana"
        ```
        
    - **Typed Array**
        - **Typed arrays** are a set of array-like objects for handling binary data in JavaScript.
        - They allow for storing and manipulating large datasets, like images, audio, or raw binary data, which can be useful in WebGL and web performance.
        - Examples include `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array`, `Float32Array`, etc., each tailored to store specific types of data (e.g., integers, unsigned integers, floating-point numbers).
        - **When to Use**: Use typed arrays for performance-intensive applications that handle binary data or large datasets (e.g., graphics, audio, or scientific calculations).
        
        **Example:**
        
        ```jsx
        let intArray = new Int16Array(2);
        
        intArray[0] = 42;
        intArray[1] = -42;
        
        console.log(intArray); // Int16Array [42, -42]
        ```
        
2. **Keyed Collections**
    
    Keyed collections store data as key-value pairs, allowing more structured data storage and efficient access by keys.
    
    - **Map**
        - **Map** is an ordered collection of key-value pairs where any value (primitive or object) can be used as a key.
        - It remembers the insertion order of keys and provides efficient access and modification.
        - **When to Use**: Use a map for key-value data when keys aren’t limited to strings, and you need to maintain insertion order or frequently update values by key.
        
        **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let userMap = new Map();
        
        userMap.set("name", "Alice");
        userMap.set("age", 30);
        
        console.log(userMap.get("name")); // "Alice"
        ```
        
    - **WeakMap**
        - **WeakMap** is similar to `Map`, but only allows **objects** as keys and holds them weakly (does not prevent garbage collection).
        - It’s useful for storing metadata about objects without creating memory leaks, as unused objects are automatically removed.
        - **When to Use**: Use a weak map when you need temporary key-value storage tied to objects that can be garbage-collected (e.g., caching object metadata).
        
        **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let weakMap = new WeakMap();
        let obj = {};
        
        weakMap.set(obj, "data");
        
        console.log(weakMap.get(obj)); // "data"
        ```
        
    - **Set**
        - **Set** is a collection of unique values. A set only stores values once, so adding duplicates has no effect.
        - It allows us to check for the existence of a value and iterate over unique values efficiently.
        - **When to Use**: Use a set when you need a collection of unique items and fast existence checks. Ideal for keeping track of unique items in a list.
        
        **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let numbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4]);
        
        console.log(numbers); // Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
        
        numbers.add(5);
        
        console.log(numbers.has(3)); // true
        ```
        
    - **WeakSet**
        - **WeakSet** is similar to `Set`, but it only holds **objects** weakly (does not prevent garbage collection) and does not allow duplicates.
        - Useful for storing temporary data that should be automatically removed if not referenced elsewhere.
        - **When to Use**: Use a weak set when you need a memory-efficient collection of unique objects that can be automatically garbage-collected, like tracking DOM elements.
        
        **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let weakSet = new WeakSet();
        let obj = { name: "Alice" };
        
        weakSet.add(obj);
        console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // true
        ```
        
3. Structured Data
    
    Structured data structures provide ways to store and transfer data in a structured format, which is especially useful in web development.
    
    - **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation)
        - **JSON** is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for both humans to read and machines to parse and generate.
        - It is widely used for exchanging data between a client and server and is represented by simple data structures: **objects** (key-value pairs) and **arrays**.
        - JavaScript provides `JSON.stringify()` to convert JavaScript objects to JSON and `JSON.parse()` to convert JSON to JavaScript objects.
        - **When to Use**: Use JSON when you need to serialize data for storage or transfer, especially in network requests and local storage. Essential for exchanging data between client and server.
        
        **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
        
        let jsonString = JSON.stringify(user); // Converts to JSON string
        
        console.log(jsonString); // '{"name":"Alice","age":30}'
        
        let parsedData = JSON.parse(jsonString); // Converts back to JavaScript object
        
        console.log(parsedData); // { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
        ```

### **Summary**

In JavaScript, these data structures help in organizing and working with data efficiently:

- **Indexed Collections**:
    - **Array**: Ordered list of elements. Use for lists where order matters.
    - **Typed Arrays**: Arrays for binary data (e.g., `Int8Array`, `Float32Array`). Use for performance-intensive binary data operations.
- **Keyed Collections**:
    - **Map**: Key-value pairs, where any value can be used as a key. Use for complex key-value data.
    - **WeakMap**: Key-value pairs with weak references to object keys. Use for temporary object-linked data.
    - **Set**: Collection of unique values. Use for collections that must not contain duplicates.
    - **WeakSet**: Collection of unique objects with weak references. Use for memory-efficient tracking of unique objects.
- **Structured Data**:
    - **JSON**: Text-based format for structured data, useful for data exchange between client and server. Use for serializing and deserializing data.
